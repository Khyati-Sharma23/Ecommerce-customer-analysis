# Ecommerce Customer Behavior Analysis

This project aims to analyze customer behavior and spending patterns for an ecommerce platform using SQL through Jupyter Notebook and Power BI.

## Tools Used
- **Jupyter Notebook**: SQL analysis using SQLite
- **SQLite**: Backend database
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and interactive dashboard creation

## Key Analyses
- Gender-wise customer distribution
- Total spend by city (Top 10 cities)
- Age group vs Satisfaction level
- Count of Customer ID by Membership type
- Total spend by city and membership type
- Average Rating by Membership type
- Correlation between satisfaction level and Total spend(on Jupyter notebook using SQL Querry)

## Files
- `Sales_and_Customer_Behaviour_Analysis.ipynb`: SQL queries and analysis
- `ecommerce_customers_2.csv`: SQLite database wasn't working so converted the file into csv by using SQLite browser
- `Ecommerce_Report.pbix`: Interactive dashboard
- Screenshots: Visual snapshots of Power BI dashboard

## Dashboard Features
- Interactive filters for city, gender, and age
- Pie chart for gender distribution
- Line/bar charts for total spend
- Matrix view for city vs membership type

## How to Use
1. Open `ecommerce_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter to review SQL queries.
2. Open `PowerBI_Dashboard.pbix` using Power BI Desktop.
